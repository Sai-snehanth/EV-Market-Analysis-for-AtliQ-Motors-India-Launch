# EV Market Analysis Workflow: SQL to Power BI with Excel and Python

## Overview
This README outlines the process for analyzing Electric Vehicle (EV) market data using SQL, Power BI, Excel, and Python. The workflow involves extracting data from a SQL database, visualizing it in Power BI, formatting in Excel, and performing advanced analysis in Python.

## 1. SQL Database Connection

### 1.1 Database Setup
- Ensure you have a SQL database set up with your EV market data.
- Tables likely include: `sales`, `manufacturers`, `models`, `regions`, etc.

### 1.2 Sample SQL Queries
- Total sales by manufacturer
- Monthly sales trend

## 2. Connecting SQL to Power BI

### 2.1 Steps to Connect
1. Open Power BI Desktop.
2. Click 'Get Data' > 'Database' > 'SQL Server'.
3. Enter your server name and database name.
4. Choose 'DirectQuery' or 'Import' mode.
5. Select relevant tables or use a custom SQL query.

### 2.2 Data Model in Power BI
- Create relationships between tables (e.g., sales to manufacturers).
- Create calculated columns and measures as needed.

## 3. Creating Visualizations in Power BI

### 3.1 Key Visualizations
- Line chart for monthly sales trend.
- Bar chart for sales by manufacturer.
- Map for regional sales distribution.
- Pie chart for market share.

### 3.2 Dashboard Creation
- Combine visualizations into a cohesive dashboard.
- Add slicers for interactivity (e.g., date range, manufacturer).

## 4. Exporting and Formatting in Excel

### 4.1 Exporting Data
- In Power BI, go to 'File' > 'Export to Excel'.
- Choose the tables/queries to export.

### 4.2 Excel Formatting
- Use conditional formatting for sales figures.
- Create pivot tables for quick analysis.
- Set up data validation for user inputs.

## 5. Advanced Analysis in Python

### 5.1 Setting Up Python Environment
- Install necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

### 5.2 Loading Data
- Load data from Excel into Python for analysis.

### 5.3 Sample Analysis
- Perform time series analysis.
- Conduct correlation analysis.
- Build predictive models.

## 6. Integrating Insights
- Use insights from Python analysis to inform Power BI visualizations.
- Create a summary report combining SQL, Power BI, and Python outputs.
- Present findings to stakeholders, highlighting key trends and predictions.

## 7. Maintenance and Updates
- Set up automated data refresh in Power BI.
- Regularly update Python scripts for ongoing analysis.
- Maintain SQL database with new data inputs.
